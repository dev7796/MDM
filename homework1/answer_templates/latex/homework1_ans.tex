\textbf{Honor Code } Students may have discussions about the homework with peers. However, each student must write down their solutions independently to show they understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by themselves.  Students should clearly mention the names of all the other students with whom they have discussions about the homework. Directly using the code or solutions obtained from the web or from others is considered an honor code violation. We check all the submissions for plagiarism and take the honor code seriously, and we hope students to do the same.
